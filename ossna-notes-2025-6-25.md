## From First PR to Lifelong Impact:
- Speakers: Suah Khan , Matt Denny, Ruth Ikegah, Dawn Foster
- Getting people to contribute and stay in your project
- Questions:
  - How did you get involved and what you do for open source
    - Ruth: Leads the Africa chapter, was the second person, first in Africa, wanted to know how to get people involved in open source. There are so many ways to contribute beyond code. One of the things is to understand where your contributers are at. Created a chapter where poeople could come together in smaller groups, such as designer, technical writers. Lastly, recognizing contributions. Last, having social events, even if it is just to have coffee
  - What are some of the CNCF initiatives:
    - Matt: Facilitator for hearing impaired groups. Particularly hard to contribute when it's hard to ask. The community needs to be welcome. There are so many people that are in underrepresented groups. Matt felt very discouraged at first, because he was in sales, found other ways to contribute.
  - Talk about how you've used some of those mentoring programs:
    - Shuah: Designing and creating mentoring programs is about figuring out who needs the help, who wants the help. Like: We have students who are balancing a workload plus they need to also get professionals. How do you get the program to work for everybody? That's what has gone into developing this program. 
  - It can be challeging to bring people with different into a community. Even data scientists do very different things from one anther. Perhaps look for people who have experience with data.
  - Ruth: There are a lot of community groups that are in tech, but not in open source. So making targeted outreach to those community. This can help attract specific people.
  - If you identify communities that you want to reach out too. 
  - Talk about the difficult task of what is my first commit, pr, contribution. How do you help communities to get involved, for new contributers? 
    - Matt: Assign a person a buddy, this can help the person feel seen and heard. Simple tactics, giving people guidance. How are we welcoming new people? Take it on yourself. 
    - Ruth: Are you fostring an environment where people can grow. How do you make the community feel safe.
    - Shuah: The kernal community is a little different. They do developement via email. So mentorship helps in that aspect. Also, have a lot of documentation on how to submit a patch. As a community most people are helpful. That is very important in making people feel welcome. Also, important to have a code of conduct.
  - Is there any advise you can give to helping the entry barriers to contribute?
    - Ruth: Start by giving a plus to the CHAOSS project. Giving advise on how to contribute to, creating documentation on how contributers can contribute in small ways. Peer mentoring helps.
    - Matt: Very simple, create less barriers to learn and contribute. For example some people are visual learners. So having more ways to contribute. 
    - Shuah: Some bootcamps have bootcamps and hackathons. And set themselves a goal of sending up a patch. Plus documentation. Even translation patches. Reviewers. 
    - Dawn: Scale your software. 
  - How can you contribute:
    - Matt: There are so many ways to contribute. How can I get your stuff to other people?
    - Run user groups
    - Help get the message out there, marketing
    - Translations, and issue triage
  - What could the coders do to help welcome the non-coders?
    - Come talk at user groups. Tell them about your issues. How to submit a good pr.
    - Providing minimal viable documentation on how to document code. Be the example.
  - How do you help people thrive:
    - Ruth: Recognize the smallest efforts that the make. Create room for mistakes.
    - Shuah: Welcoming communities help retain people. Maintainers should share there failures. Today's new developers are our future. Mentorships are the way to the future.
    - Matt: Talk to everyone and don't be a jerk. You never know who the next contributer can be. Talk to everyone possible.
    - Dawn: Ask paople for specific things that you know that they are good at. Think about the people that are good at things and ask them.
