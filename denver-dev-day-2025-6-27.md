## Simplifying Frontend Development with Alpine.js
- Speaker: Hunter Trammell
- Key Takeaways:

## What’s Your Vector, Victor? A Dive Into Vector Data Support in Azure SQL DB
- Speaker: Jason Horner
- Flying High with Azure SQL's 
- DBA?
- What is a Vector?
  - A vector is an ordered list of numbers used tro represent data in a way that machines can understand
  - Vectors are used to represent:
    - Words or sentences --> Embedding
    - Images --> Pixel vectors
    - User Profiles --> Featur vectors
  - Why vectors Matter:
    - Captures semantic meaning numerically
    - Enables comparison
  - Vector Example Colors
    - Red will always === to red, but rbg is not going to be === to 
  - Vector-search Example - making things similar 
  - Vector-Measuring Distance
  - Euclidean?
  - Vector-Distance Summary
    - Dot Product
- Vector Use Cases
  - Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
    - With RAG you can encode proproetery information
  - Conversational AI
  - Recommendation engines
  - Vector search 
- Embeddings:
  - Scenerio:
    - You want to find support articles to the question:
      "How can I get back into my account?"
    ```
    - Select *
    - From: support_articles
    - Where: `title` Like '%get back into my accounts%';
    ```
  - How it works:
    - Only finds rows where the exact phrase or substring appears
    - Fails in someone wrote "Recover access to account" or "reset logon credentials".
      - Matches only literal text -- no understanding of meaning or sysnonyms
- Azure Open AI Embedding Models
  - Generally speaking start with the baseline
  - We can create vector presentations of images
  - Data sources:
    - Images 
    - Audio
    - Videa
    - Text
      --> Transform into embedding that has a vector representation
- Vector Data Typr
  - Each element is a 4 byte floating point
  - Vector demensions are from 1 - 1998
    - Behind the scenes being stored in a bianary representation
- Vector Data Type - Column Defininition
  - Convertable from (n)varchar and json data types
  - Displayed as a JSON array
  - No DEFUALT, CHECK, PK, FK
  - No indexes (yet)
- Vector Data Type - Variable
  - The vector type can be stored 
- Vector Data Type - Sprocs and functions
- Vector Data Type - Functions
  - VECTOR_DISTANCE
  - VECTOR_SEARCH
  - VECTOR_NORM

## Beyond the Framework: Building Resilient Front-End Architectures
- Speaker: Hunter Trammell
1. The problem with framework-first thinking
  - This is something that has become very common
  - JavaScript Frameworks - need to create reactivity in the DOM
    - jQuery --> Angular --> React (compiler frameworks)
  - 2 issues:
    - Requirenments have changed
    - Native technologies have come a long way
  - We've become to using the frameworks
  - The tools drive the solution
    - Defaulting to popular tools without analysis can lead to misalignment
  - Thoughtful architecture is neededto address the growing complexity in frontend systems
  - How do we solve this problem:
    1. ddd
    1. ddd
    1. dddd
2. Achetectural thinking
  - Every developer === Architect
  - Understanding the requirenments
    - Technical requirenments
    - Non-Technical requirenments
    - Domaine requirenments
    - Illities
      - Scalibility
      - Performance
      - Accessibility
  - Archetecture happends at every level of build and design
    - Trade-offs vs Prioritization
  - Everything is a trade-oof understanding the "why' is more important than the "how"
3. Patterns + Priciples for front-end Architecture
  - Modularity
  - Seperation of concerns
  - Reusability + Composability
  - Simplicity
  - Event Driven Architecture
    - Decouples systems
    - Reflects real behavior in the browser
    - Collaboration Scale
  - Atomic Design in Action
    - Start small and purposful
    - Compose with intention
    - Architect for scale
4. Architecture as a daily habit
  - Define the problem first
  - Evaluate fit, not flash
  - Design the system, then fill the gaps
  - Manage Dependencies
    - Evaluate with intent - does this solve the problem
    - Own your abstractions - create a clear boundry, in case you want/need to remove it
    - Reassess Regularly
- Everyday Architecture
  - Architecture is a team sport
  - Intention over habit
  - Principles over habit
  - Adapt and learn

## Data Strategy, Quality, and Trust Walk Into a Bar…
- Speakers: Cher Fox - Fox Consulting, Kamal Maheshwari - Decube
- ERP?
- InsightJam.com
- DAMA? DAMA Certified Data MAnagement (CDMP)
- How would you describe the relationaship between strategy, data quality & Data trust?
  - You can't have one of these things wihtout the others
- In an organization everybody is responsible for the data
- Users lose confidence if they are getting bad data
- We are not creating data literacy for how data drives 
- What are the key foundations of a good data strategy?
  - Don't make strategy a 50 page doc, make it more practcal, it's a pracitce, living thing
  - Create a measurable way to put a number on data
  - How is the data going to make anything better for them?
    - What are your business goals to understand what data you need?
  - What are the biggest challenges to maintaining Data Quality, especially in environmnets with high quality volume & velocity?
  - Myths:
    - It's not a problem for me. Our company is too small.
    - I know what to do. I did it 10 years ago.
    - I don't see any value in it.
  - How can data professionals effectivly communicate the importance of data strategy, quality & trust to non-technical business leaders?
    - We need to create the context
  - Looking ahead, what trends do you see emerging in data strategy, quality and trust?
  - What shoud organizations be preparing for?
- If you were advising an orgaqnization just starting to build out its data capabilities. whta are the first three steps you recommend?
  - Usecases
  - Simplify things
  - Pay attention to client needs
- Quantumn?


## Design for Non-Designers (from a Non-Designer)
- Speaker: Jay Harris
- Technical communication
- Why?
  - Recognize the purpose of design
  - Usability
  - Functionality
  - It needs to be usable
- Fundamentals
  - Unity
    - Cohition of structure
    - Cohesion through style
      - Cohesion of color
      - Typeface
    - You are always tell a story
  - Contrast
    - Shade
    - color
    - position
    - size
    - shape
  - Alignment
    - Based on location
    - 
  - Proximity
    - influences interpretation of data
    - influences iterpretation of the flow
  - Hierachy
    - We see this in the images
    - Text - title is the most important thing
    - Helps us parce data
  - Whitespace
    - congestion
    - isolation
- Color 
  - RBG for screen, subtractive
  - CYM for Print, additive
  - RBY - Not additive, not subtractive
  - Color palette choices
    - Monochrome
    - Analogous
    - Complementary
    - Split Complementary
    - Triadic
    - Tetradic
- Psyhology of color
  - There is not a lot of science behind the psychology of color
  - Most people just use the colors they like
  - We don't need to care about the psycholoogy about the color, we need to care about accessability
    - Statistically many pwoplw have a color imparative
    - Colorblindness
      - protan
      - deutan
      - tritan
- Typeface
  - serif - variability in the with if the line, stress, serif. Incredibly easy to read. Great in body copy
  - san-sarif - monoweight, work great in headers
  - Scripts - are difficult to read, came about because we used to write with fountain pens, cursive is a work around for technology.
  - Decorative - not for a professional context.
  - Conflict
   - 
  - Texture
  - Base font
  - retraint
- Compostion
  - Figure out your focal point to be
  - Strong alighnment
  - repetition - this creates unity
- Context switching === confusion

- Contrast is big differnce
- Follow the rules
- Slide:ology - Nancy Duarte
- The non-designers design book - DR. Robin Williams
- Practice the concepts
