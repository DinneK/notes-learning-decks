- 4 Principles
  - Building the commons: From Code to hardware
  - 
  - Templates for Trust: Governece, Preservation, and Reuse
  - 
- Making Openness Work for more People
- 4 Challanges:
  - Opensess must supprt, not expose
  - Holistic view of infrastructure - full system
  - Open ecosystems run ib unseen labor.
  - Take part in shaping policy that shape the system

## Building InnerSource Communities
- Speaker: Shanmugapriya (Priya), Open Source Engineering Advisor and Code
- Focus on the maintainers role
- What is InnerSource?
  - Applying open source ways of working to inner companies
- Benefits
  - Shorter Development time
  -
  -
  -
- What makes all the difference?
  - How well is the solution reused?
  - How good is the cross team collaboration
- Reusability
  - The maintainers need to asses the reusability
- InnerSource Readiness
  - Insuring repo readiness
  - Ready for anyone to create a branch and make a contribution
- Dicoverability
  - Ensuring you repo is discoverable
  - Make it visable
    - As small as tagging it with an innersource tag
- Governance policy
- Transparency
- Inclusiveness
  - Denotes being generic enough that it doesn't only need to be used by more than just the specific solution, so that anyone can use it.
- Open Mindset
  - Should take in the 
- Open communication
- Is there more?
  - The maintainers can:
    - Bridge the gap - Reduce the gap between the users and the maintainers, letting people the know the poject is available.
    - Plan to nurture the community - important to respond in a timely manner tot the community
    - Acknowledge contributions - This goes a long way to building community
    - Entrust the community
- InnerSource Journey Roadmap
  - Sounds like opensource, but unlike open source, users don't usually contribute unless they have a stake in the project.
- Summary
  - We need to recognize the contributions of innersource projects
- Questions:
  - Do you have some examples of documentation?
    - GitHub commens repo
  - What strategies would recommend to recommend to leaders to have employees contribute to innersource?
    - Make coworkers who are familiar with open source and make them the drivers.
  - How do you know if a particular project is successful? What are the KPIs or data.
    - How many people are using the project?
    - How many people are contributing?
  - REMARK: Besides the things you can automate with the metrics, telling the story is even more important.
    - List of items that are delivered leveraging inner source.
  - Do you have any issue of breakage? 
    - Create a common answer draft 

## The Power of "AND" A New Template for Open Source Sustainability
- Speakers Francesca Romano, Corporate Philanthropy; Alyssa Wright, 
- Bloomberg is an open source first company
- Same Crises, Different Year:
  - 2014 Heartbleed
  - Burnout
  - The Power of "AND"
- Open Source relies on volunteers
  - Unsustainable Reliance of Volunteers
- Fragile Foundations
- Limited View of Corporate Responsibilities
- Unbalanced Corporate engagemnet
- Urgent need for a new approach

- What if the future of open source wasn't about these two things
  1. What is the business value?
    - Accelerated Time to Market
    - Developer Retention
- Why not include philanthropy and business
- Start looking 
- How is any of that "business value"?
- Fostering long term community practice and long term 
- tl;dr: Public Impact Strengthens Business Value
- Public impact is a businesss a imperative
  - It's how we collectively thrive
- Partnership...
- How do we move beyond the transactional
- When we partner, think about...
  - Project impact
  - Business impact
  - Public good impact
  - Participant impact
- What We've Built Together
  - Foundation engagement
  - Individual giving
  - Team Volunteering
  - FOSS Contributor Fund
- So why now
  - And NOW...This
    1. Exploding open source dependencies
    1. Complex global challenges
    1. Accelerated Innovation
    1. Talent & Reputation Imperative
- Q&A:
  - Does Bloomberg have people contributing to open source during office hours?
  - Reputation side, between coporate and individual, Does the company moniter open source guidence?
  - The future of work, Do you see a future where you start to view software as being responsibility sourced?  
  - Have run into situation of conflict of interest?
    - They do a risk a assessment
  - If you are asked to list the open source that you used? 

## Building the Future Developer
- Speakers: Kim Schlesinger, Pheobe Quincy
- The Open Source Landscape
  - What's Changed:
    - Everything
    - Educators, employers and students need guidance
  - What's in the past:
    - Early 2000s
      - In the early 2000s it was about community
      - Projects like, Apache, MySQL
      - Pretty much self tought
      - There wasn't really social coding, such as version control like GitHub
    - Mid 2000s
      - Developer pipeline like we know it really took hold
      - Open source enabled real-world learning
      - The app economy of builders
    - Today: Open source in 2025
      - It's inner woven into todays business in a way that's never been before
      - Now big tech is investing into open source
        - Disney, Honda, etc
      - Learning happens in the open
    - We are witnessing a huge movement with AI
  - What's in the Future:
    - 776 professionals were randomly assigned to work with real world products
    - A look at the impact of GitHub copilot on the nature of work.
  - Key Effects on Educators ans students
    - Attitudes of students, teachers, tech proffesionals
- The future Developer:
- How do we teach developers to evaluate
- The AILit Framework
  - Knowledge
  - Skills
  - Attitudes 
  - Design
  - Managing
  - Developing
- Contributers:
  - Do we need to add guidance 
  - Explicity diclose AI contribution 
  - Use AI to get feedback for you review
